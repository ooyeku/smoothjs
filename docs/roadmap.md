# Library Evaluation and Roadmap

Below is a concise evaluation of your library’s current state, followed by a prioritized feature roadmap with concrete, testable outcomes.

## Current strengths
- Cohesive “micro-stack”: Components, router, store/selectors, HTTP client, utilities, data querying/caching, SSR hooks, design system, testing helpers, and a CLI. This is unusually complete for a minimal framework.
- Zero-dependency ethos: Small footprint and straightforward APIs that are easy to reason about and adopt incrementally.
- ESM-first + modern dev flow: Works well with modern tooling and can also be used directly in the browser.
- Practical robustness: HTTP client with timeout/abort and structured errors; store with selectors; simple query cache with dedupe; testing utilities; SSR-awareness.
- Aesthetic/design layer: The design system adds value early (tokens/utilities/components), differentiating from many “barebones” micro frameworks.

## Notable gaps and risks
- Rendering granularity: Full re-renders are simple but can get costly for dynamic UIs; lack of keyed reconciliation and lifecycle error boundaries.
- Composition model: Limited story for props/children/context and component encapsulation patterns (slots/portals).
- SSR completeness: No clearly documented hydration strategy, streaming/partial hydration, or router-level data loading on the server.
- Router sophistication: Missing nested routes/layouts, lazy routes, link components, and active-state helpers.
- Data layer maturity: Query cache lacks invalidation by tag/scope, mutation helpers, and background revalidation policies.
- DevTools and diagnostics: No inspector/time-travel, limited runtime warnings, and no formal plugin hooks.
- Type safety and distribution: Types exist but need completeness and generics; no dual builds or size-optimized browser bundle by default.
- Accessibility and UX: Few first-class a11y primitives, focus management helpers, and transition/animation utilities.
- Security: No formal sanitization strategy beyond basic escaping for untrusted content.

## Proposed roadmap

### Phase 1: Core runtime and composition — Completed (see examples/CompositionPage.js, components/ContextDemo.js, components/PortalDemo.js, components/ChildrenDemo.js, components/DataTable.js [keyed], and pages/ErrorPage.js)
- Fine-grained updates
  - Add keyed reconciliation for lists and minimal diffing for attribute/text nodes.
  - Outcome: Rendering cost scales with change size; list reorders preserve state.
- Error boundaries
  - Component-level try/catch zones with fallback UI and recovery.
  - Outcome: Subtree crashes don’t bring down the app; clear error surfaces.
- Composition primitives
  - Props/children API, context providers/consumers, and portals.
  - Outcome: Reusable, composable components without prop drilling.

### Phase 2: SSR + hydration — Completed (see examples/ssr.html and tests/ssr.test.js)
- Hydration path
  - Documented server render + client hydrate API; preserve event handlers and state.
  - Outcome: Benchmarked SSR-to-interactive with correctness tests.
- Streaming SSR and partial hydration (optional/experimental)
  - Streamed HTML and islands for large pages.
  - Outcome: Faster TTFB/LCP on content-heavy routes.

### Phase 3: Router and data integration
- Router upgrades
  - Nested routes/layouts, dynamic params, link component, active class handling, route guards with redirect, lazy-loaded routes.
  - Outcome: Real-world SPA routing patterns out of the box.
- Query client enhancements
  - Mutations with optimistic updates, tag/scoped invalidation, background revalidation (stale-while-revalidate), focus/reconnect refetch policies.
  - Outcome: Ergonomic, robust data flows akin to lightweight React Query.

### Phase 4: Styling/design system maturity
- Component primitives and tokens
  - Expand a small set of headless and styled primitives (Button, Input, Modal, Tabs) with keyboard navigation and a11y baked in.
  - Theme variants and dark mode system-wide toggles; responsive utilities.
  - Outcome: Out-of-the-box professional UX while remaining opt-in.

### Phase 5: Tooling, types, and DX
- TypeScript types completeness
  - Generic-friendly types for components, store selectors, router params, http client responses, and query results.
  - Outcome: Strong editor IntelliSense and safe APIs.
- DevTools and diagnostics
  - Minimal overlay for runtime errors; console-time measurements; optional debug builds with warnings.
  - Outcome: Faster debugging and better developer feedback loops.
- Packaging
  - Dual outputs (ESM + CJS), minified browser bundle with source maps, explicit exports map, and sideEffects hints verified.
  - Outcome: Smooth consumption across environments; improved tree-shaking.

### Phase 6: Testing utilities and accessibility
- Testing helpers
  - Mount/render APIs with snapshot-friendly output, async helpers for queries/mutations, and router/store testing patterns.
  - Outcome: Lower friction for writing confidence-building tests.
- A11y utilities
  - Focus traps, ARIA helpers, live region updates, and skip-link patterns.
  - Outcome: Better accessibility defaults and easier compliance.

### Phase 7: Security and forms
- Sanitization strategy
  - Pluggable sanitizer for unsafe HTML, documented guidelines for user content.
  - Outcome: Reduced XSS risk with clear, tested contracts.
- Form helpers
  - Small helpers for validation, touched/dirty tracking, and form-to-state bindings.
  - Outcome: Common CRUD flows become trivial.

## Acceptance criteria examples
- Rendering: Re-render cost for a 1,000-item list update improves by at least 5x for single-item changes; keyed lists preserve input focus and caret.
- Router: Nested routes demo with lazy subroutes; active link states; parameterized routes with type-safe accessors.
- Data: Mutation APIs support optimistic updates and rollback; focus/refetch policies configurable; stale-while-revalidate demonstrated.
- SSR: Sample app renders server-side and hydrates without checksum mismatch; streaming example passes integration tests.
- Types: No-implicit-any across public APIs; generics for store selectors and query results; DTS tests pass in a template project.
- A11y: Keyboard navigation across components; axe-core checks pass in example app.
- Security: Sanitization tests for common XSS vectors; documentation describes safe rendering patterns.

## Suggested short-term milestones (2–3 weeks each)
1) Keyed diff + error boundaries + props/children/context, with benchmarks and examples.  
2) Router nesting + Link + lazy routes; query mutations + invalidation.  
3) Hydration path + types hardening + minimal DevTools overlay.  
4) A11y primitives + form helpers + packaging polish (dual builds + minified bundle).

---

Here’s a high-level view of major features commonly expected in a frontend library that are not present yet, along with why they matter and where they’d fit.

Core rendering and composition
- Granular updates (virtual DOM/diffing or fine-grained reactivity): Avoid full re-renders of a component subtree and support keyed reconciliation for lists.
- Component inputs/outputs: Props, children/slots/portals, and event emitters to enable composition patterns beyond a single class with internal state.
- Context/dependency injection: Provide values across component trees without prop drilling.
- Memoization/derived state: Computed values and selectors to prevent redundant recalculations and renders.
- Error boundaries: Catch rendering errors in component subtrees and display fallbacks.

Templating and ergonomics
- JSX or a template compiler: Authoring ergonomics, conditional rendering, list rendering, and directive-like helpers (show/if/for, class/style bindings).
- Two-way binding helpers: Simple patterns for forms and inputs.
- Safer HTML templating: Built-in sanitization for untrusted HTML beyond simple escaping.

Routing
- Nested routes and layouts: Compose pages hierarchically.
- Dynamic params, route loaders, and route-level data fetching: Fetch before enter, block/redirect on auth, pass params into components.
- Code-splitting/lazy routes: Load route components on demand.
- Link component and active state handling: SPA-friendly navigation primitives.

State management
- Selectors and memoized derived state: Efficient subscriptions.
- Middleware/effects model: For async flows and side effects.
- DevTools integration and time-travel debugging: Inspect and replay state changes.
- Persistence plugins: Opt-in localStorage/sessionStorage syncing.

Data fetching
- Query/cache layer (SWR/React Query–style): Request deduping, caching, revalidation, mutations, and invalidation.
- Suspense-like primitives: Declarative pending/error/fulfilled UI.

SSR/SSG and hydration
- Server-side rendering and hydration: Generate HTML on the server and attach behavior on the client.
- Streaming SSR and partial hydration: Performance for large pages.
- Isomorphic routing/data loading: Unified patterns across server and client.

Styling and theming
- Scoped styles or CSS modules: Avoid global CSS collisions.
- CSS-in-JS or utility helpers: Theming, variables, dark mode, and runtime style composition.

Accessibility and UX
- A11y utilities: Focus management primitives, ARIA helpers, and live region helpers.
- Transition/animation helpers: Declarative animations and page transitions.

Tooling and DX
- TypeScript types: First-class typings and generic-friendly APIs.
- CLI/scaffolding: Project creation, development server with HMR, build pipeline.
- Testing utilities: Component mounting/render helpers, test IDs, and mock utilities.
- Linting rules and codemods: Consistent patterns and safe upgrades.
- Dev warnings and runtime checks: Helpful messages for anti-patterns in dev mode.

Packaging and distribution
- Multiple builds: ESM, CJS, and minified browser bundles with proper sideEffects flags for tree-shaking.
- Source maps and well-defined semver/changelog.
- Plugin/extension API: Ecosystem growth.

Internationalization
- i18n primitives: Message formatting, locale switching, async locale loading, and ICU compatibility.

Performance and reliability
- Update batching and scheduling: Coalesce multiple state updates and prioritize work.
- Event delegation and passive listeners by default: Fewer listeners, improved scroll/touch performance.
- Resource management: Automatic cleanup patterns and leak detection.

Security
- Hardened XSS mitigation: Sanitization strategies for dynamic content beyond basic escaping.
