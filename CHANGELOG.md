Highlights:
- Core runtime and composition

  - SSR.renderToString for server rendering; Component.hydrate() for client attachment.
  - Example page (examples/ssr.html) with dark-mode-aware pre-hydration styling.
- Router
  - Nested routes with router outlets, dynamic params, lazy routes, link helper with active class.
  - Route guards (beforeEach) supporting redirects.

  - UI components: Button, Input, Modal (with focus trap), Tabs; utilities and theme tokens.
- A11y utilities
